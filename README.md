# An atm simulator written in c++

---

## Basic features
- server-client logic for data communication
- data encrypt for security
- database.cpp for handling database files externally on hard drive. ( I just wanted it to be simple so I didn't use SQL or any dbms)
- This project's goal is to be able to make transactions, real time account watch... anything that a real atm can do.
---

## 
- actually securityServer doesn't anything. 

## TODO :
[ ] Succesfully login.
[ ] Succesfully logout.
[ ] Succesfully access the database from atmClient side.
[ ] Succesfully Make transactions
[ ] Succesfully write data into database
